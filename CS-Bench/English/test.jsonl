Therefore, depth-first traversal can detect whether a directed graph has a cycle. During topological sorting, a vertex can only be added to the sequence when it is not the head of any edge. If there is a cycle, the vertices in the cycle are always the head of some edge and cannot be added to the topological sequence. In other words, if there are still vertices that cannot be found to be added to the topological sequence, it indicates that the graph has a cycle. Finding the shortest path allows the graph to have cycles. As for whether the critical path can determine if a graph has a cycle, there is some controversy. Although the critical path itself does not allow cycles, the algorithm for finding the critical path cannot determine whether there are cycles. Determining whether there are cycles is the first step in finding the critical path\u2014topological sorting. Therefore, the answer to this question mainly depends on the perspective from which you approach the problem. Candidates need to understand the issue itself, as the real unified examination will not involve such ambiguous questions."}

However, currently, there are only 240 nodes on the 9th level, indicating that the 9th level is not full and is the last level. Levels 1 to 8 are full, so the total number of nodes = 2^8 + 240 = 495. Since the 9th level is the last level, all nodes on the 9th level are leaf nodes. Moreover, the parents of the 240 nodes on the 9th level are on the 8th level, with the number of parents being 120, which means there are 120 branch nodes on the 8th level, and the rest are leaf nodes.

This is because only if i \u2264 j, the arc <i, j> can appear in the upper triangle of the adjacency matrix."}

And why?", "Answer": "In a hash table, when deleting a record, it can be physically removed in the case of separate chaining. However, in the case of open addressing, it cannot be physically removed; instead, a deletion marker must be used. The address might be on the synonym search path for the record, and physically removing it would break the search path, as encountering an empty address during the search is considered a search failure."}
{"ID": 531, "Split": "Test", "Domain": "Data Structure and Algorithm", "SubDomain": "Searching", "Format": "Open-ended", "Tag": "Reasoning", "Language": "English", "Question": "For a sequential search on an ordered and unordered list with n elements, discuss whether the average search length is the same for both under equal search probability in the following three cases:\n(1) Search failure.\n(2) Search success, and there is only one element in the list with a key equal to the given value k.\n(3) Search success, and there are several elements in the list with keys equal to the given value k, with the requirement that a single search can find all elements.", "Answer": "(1) The average search length is different. In an ordered sequential list, the search stops when an element with a key value greater than the value being searched for is found, and a failure message is reported; there is no need to search until the end of the list. In contrast, an unordered sequential list must be searched until the end to determine that the search has failed.\n\n(2) The average search length is the same. Both stop searching when an element with a key value equal to the given value is found in the list.\n\n(3) The average search length is different. In an ordered sequential list, elements with equal key values are arranged consecutively, so finding the first one allows for continuous searching of other elements with the same key value. In an unordered sequential list, all elements in the list must be searched to find those with the same key value, resulting in different search times."}

This process either locates the desired element or reduces the set to 1/k of its original size. If the element is not found, continue performing k-ary search on the resulting subset. Repeat this process until the element is found or the search fails. Determine the time complexity for both successful and unsuccessful searches.", "Answer": "Similar to binary search, the k-ary search method can be described using a k-ary tree. In the worst case, starting from the second level, each level compares k-1 times. A k-ary tree with n nodes has a depth of [log_kn] + 1, so the number of comparisons with the given key during a successful k-ary search is at most (k-1)\u00d7[log_kn], which means the time complexity is O(log_kn).

There is a file composed of 20,000,000 records, each record being 200B, including a 5B key. What should be the order of the B-tree in this file using B-tree indexing? Assuming the data part of the file is not ordered by the key, how many disk page blocks would the index part occupy?", "Answer": "According to the concept of B-trees, an index node should fit the physical record size of a single read/write operation by the operating system, and its size should be no more than but as close as possible to the size of a disk page block. Assuming the B-tree is of order m, a B-tree node can store at most m-1 keys (5B each) and their corresponding record addresses (5B), m child pointers (5B each), and an integer indicating the actual number of keys in the node (2B), the following equation holds:\n(2*(m-1)+m)*5 +2 \u2264 4000, which calculates to m \u2264 267. An index node can store at most m-1=266 index entries, and at least m/2|-1=133 index entries. With a total of n=20000000 records, each record occupying 200B of space, and each page block able to store 4000/200=20 records, the total records are distributed across 20000000/20=1000000 page blocks. At most, 1000000/133=7519 disk page blocks are needed for the B-tree index, and at least 1000000/266=3760 disk page blocks are needed for the B-tree index (note the difference between B-trees and B+-trees, where in B-trees, index entries for data records are distributed across nodes at all levels, whereas in B+-trees, all index entries for data records are in the leaf nodes)."}

What are the two relatively independent stages included in multi-way balanced merge sort? What tasks are completed in each stage?", "Answer": "Multi-way balanced merge sort consists of two relatively independent phases: the generation of initial merge segments phase and the multi-pass merge sort phase. During the generation of initial merge segments phase, a disk file with n records is loaded into memory in batches according to the size of the memory workspace, where an efficient internal sorting method is used to sort each batch, resulting in several sorted subfiles, i.e., initial merge segments. The multi-pass merge sort phase employs a multi-way merge method to merge these segments pass by pass until a single sorted file is obtained."}

Can a queue be used to implement this stack? Why or why not?", "Answer": "A queue can be used to replace a stack. During the process of quicksort, through a single partition, a given interval to be sorted can be divided into two subintervals, which are then subjected to the same partitioning process. The role of the stack is to save the upper and lower bounds of one subinterval while processing the other (new left and right subintervals may be generated during the sorting process). Once the current interval is processed, the bounds of the next subinterval are retrieved from the stack for processing. This function can also be achieved using a queue, with the only difference being the order in which the subintervals are processed."}

Bubble sort, heap sort, and selection sort can determine the smallest element in each pass. Heap sort is the most appropriate because for a sequence of n elements, the time to build the initial heap does not exceed 4n, and the time to sort the sequence before obtaining the k-th smallest element is klog2n, with a total time of 4n+klog2n. The time taken by bubble sort and selection sort to complete this function is n, and when k\u22655, it can be concluded through comparison that heap sort is optimal."}

The priority of DMA is higher than that of program interrupts II. Program interrupt mode requires context saving, while DMA mode does not require context saving III. The interrupt request in program interrupt mode is to report the end of data transfer to the CPU, whereas the interrupt request in DMA mode is solely for data transfer.", "A": "Only II", "B": "II, III", "C": "Only III", "D": "I, III", "Answer": "C", "Explanation": "DMA (Direct Memory Access) mode does not require CPU pre-transfer operations, only borrowing a little CPU time at the beginning and end, without occupying any other CPU resources. Interrupt mode involves program switching, where each operation requires saving and restoring the context, so DMA has a higher priority than interrupt requests, thereby speeding up processing efficiency. Therefore, statement I is correct. From the analysis, it is known that program interrupts require interrupting the current program, hence the need to save the context so that after the interrupt is completed, it can return to the original point to continue the unfinished work. DMA mode does not need to interrupt the current program and does not require saving the context, so statement I is correct. Statement II is just the opposite."}

The execution time T of the program is T = CPI\u00d7T_IC\u00d7I, where T_IC is the duration of one CPU clock cycle, which is the reciprocal of the CPU clock frequency f, thus T = CPI\u00d7T_IC\u00d7I = CPI\u00d7(1/f)\u00d7I = 5.6\u00d710^-8\u00d7I seconds. In this problem, I should not affect the solution; the execution time of the program should be the expected number of instructions, which is CPI, multiplied by the clock cycle duration, that is, T = CPI\u00d7T_IC."}

Therefore, they all need to use pulse stuffing to increase the data rate to 8kb/s. Then, by multiplexing these 8 signals, the required communication capacity is 8kb/s \u00d7 8 = 64kb/s."}

During direct delivery, routers are not involved.", "A": "I and II", "B": "II and III", "C": "III and IV", "D": "I and IV", "Answer": "B", "Explanation": "Routing selection is divided into direct delivery and indirect delivery. Direct delivery is used when the sending station and the destination station are in the same network segment; otherwise, indirect delivery is used. Therefore, I is correct, II is incorrect. The last router in indirect delivery must use direct delivery. Incorrect direct delivery occurs within the same network segment, hence it does not involve a router, so IV is correct."}

Hardware addresses are only locally significant, so each time a router forwards an IP datagram to a specific network, it must re-encapsulate the source hardware address and the destination hardware address.

In circuit switching, a dedicated communication path is established and maintained between the communicating parties until the communication session ends. This method is mainly used in traditional telephone networks. Circuit switching focuses on establishing and maintaining a continuous transmission path, rather than performing error detection and correction during transmission. Error control functions are typically implemented by higher-level protocols (such as transport layer protocols) rather than by circuit switching itself."}

The specific method is as follows: at the transmitter, before a bit is added to the flag field, the hardware scans the bit stream, and whenever five consecutive \"1\" bits are detected, a \"0\" is inserted after them; at the receiver, the F field is located first to determine the boundary, then the bit stream within it is scanned, and whenever five consecutive \"1\" bits are found, the \"0\" following these five \"1\" bits is removed, thereby restoring the original bit stream."}

The first strategy involves segmenting the file into packets, with the receiver acknowledging each packet individually, but the file as a whole is not acknowledged. The second strategy does not acknowledge individual packets, but instead acknowledges the entire file once it has been completely received. Please discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods.", "Answer": "If the network is prone to packet loss, it is better to acknowledge each packet individually, only retransmitting the lost packets. On the other hand, if the network is highly reliable, then an acknowledgment is sent only once at the end of the entire file transfer, provided no errors occur, thus reducing the number of acknowledgments and saving bandwidth. However, even if only a single packet is lost, the entire file must be retransmitted."}

For example, if a process writes 1024B to a connection and later writes another 1024B, the receiver reads a total of 2048B. For message streams, the receiver will get two messages, each 1024B. However, for byte streams, message boundaries are not recognized, and the receiver will treat the entire 2048B as a whole, which does not reflect the fact that there were originally two distinct messages."}

Under the control of the protocol, communication between the two peer entities enables the current layer to provide services to the layer above, and to implement the protocol of the current layer, the services provided by the layer below are needed.

The service users of the current layer can only see the services and not the underlying protocols, meaning the protocols below are transparent to the service users above. 2) Protocols are \"horizontal,\" that is, protocols are rules that control communication between two peer entities.

Now, using this protocol to send 10^6 bytes of data, one byte gets corrupted during transmission, resulting in the packet containing that byte being discarded. Calculate the total number of \"overhead + lost\" bytes for packet sizes of 1000 bytes and 20000 bytes, respectively. What is the optimal value for the packet data size?", "Answer": "Let D be the size of the data packet. The required number of packets is 10^6/D. The overhead is 100xN (the overhead of the discarded packets' headers is also included), so the 'overhead + loss' is 100x10^6/D + D. When D = 1000, the 'overhead + loss' is 100x10^6/1000 + 1000 = 101000B. When D = 20000, the 'overhead + loss' is 100x10^6/20000 + 20000 = 25000B. Let the total number of bytes of 'overhead + loss' be y, then y = 10^8/D + D. To find the total differential, we have dy/dD = 1 - 10^8/D^2.

There are k links from the source to the destination, with a propagation delay of d seconds for each link, and a data transmission rate of b bits/second. The circuit establishment time for circuit switching is s seconds. In packet switching, the packet length is p bits, and the queuing delay at each node can be neglected. Under what conditions will the delay of packet switching be less than that of circuit switching? (Hint: Draw a sketch to indicate how many nodes there are for each link.)", "Answer": "Due to the neglect of queuing delay, the circuit switching delay = connection delay + transmission delay + propagation delay, while the packet switching delay = transmission delay + propagation delay. Clearly, the propagation delay for both is kd. For circuit switching, since store-and-forward technology is not used, even though there are k segments of links, there is no store-and-forward delay after the connection, hence the transmission delay = data block length / channel bandwidth = x/b, thus the total delay for circuit switching is s+x/b+kd (1). For packet switching, assuming there are n packets, because of the use of store-and-forward technology, the transmission delay at one station is t=p/b. Obviously, after the data flows through the channel for k-1 time periods, starting from the kth, one packet will arrive at the destination station per time period (after separating the discussion of propagation delay and transmission delay, propagation delay is no longer considered here), thus the transmission delay for each packet is (k-1)t+nt=(k-1)p/b+np/b, and the total delay for packet switching is kd+(k-1)p/b+np/b. Comparing equation (1) and equation (2), to make the packet switching delay less than the circuit switching delay, it is required that kd+(k-1)p/b+np/b<s+x/b+kd. For packet switching, when np\u2248x and (k-1)p/b<s, the total delay for packet switching is less than the total delay for circuit switching."}

The next node temporarily stores the message and forwards it to the next node when the output line is free, repeating this process until it reaches the destination node. Each PDU can independently choose its path to the destination node. The difference lies in the fact that the PDUs generated by packet switching are shorter and of a fixed length, whereas the PDUs generated by message switching are not of a fixed length. It is this difference that gives packet switching its unique advantages: \u2460 Buffer management is easier; \u2461 The average delay of packets is smaller, and the average buffer occupied in the network is less; \u2462 Standardization is easier; \u2463 It is more suitable for applications.

What is the maximum channel utilization for the following three protocols? 1) Stop-and-wait protocol. 2) Go-Back-N protocol. 3) Selective Repeat protocol (assuming the send window and receive window are equal).", "Answer": "The maximum channel utilization is the maximum number of frames that can be sent by each protocol in each transmission cycle. According to the problem statement, the data length is 1kbit, and the channel data transmission rate is 50kb/s, so the channel's transmission delay is 1/50s=0.02s, and the channel's end-to-end propagation delay is 0.27s. In this problem, the acknowledgment frame is piggybacked (sent through the data frame), so the transmission cycle for each data is (0.02+0.27+0.02+0.27)s=0.58s. 1) In the stop-and-wait protocol, the sender must wait for the receiver's acknowledgment signal after sending each frame before sending the next frame; the receiver must send back an acknowledgment signal after receiving each frame, indicating readiness to receive the next one. The time used to send a data frame is 0.02s. Therefore, the maximum channel utilization is 0.02/0.58=3.4%. 2) In the Go-Back-N protocol with a receive window size of 1, if n bit numbering is used, the size of the send window V must satisfy 1<W<2^n-1. The sender can continuously send several data frames until all frames in the send window are sent. If an acknowledgment frame from the receiver is received, the sender can continue sending. If an error occurs, the receiver simply discards that frame and all subsequent frames, and the sender must retransmit that data frame and all subsequent data frames after a timeout. According to the problem conditions, to achieve the maximum transmission rate, the size of the send window should be 2^n-1=7. In this case, within the first frame's transmission cycle of 0.58s, 7 frames are actually sent continuously (considering the extreme case, after 0.58s, the receiver has only received the acknowledgment for frame 0, and then a new frame can be sent, and so on, taking the limit as sending 7 frames every transmission cycle of 0.58s), thus the maximum channel utilization at this time is 7x0.02/0.58=24.1%. 3) In the Selective Repeat protocol, both the receive window size and the send window size are greater than 1, allowing multiple frames to be sent or received at once. If n bits are used for frame numbering, the window sizes should satisfy: receive window size + send window size \u2264 2^n.

The sender can continuously send several data frames until all frames in the send window are sent. If an acknowledgment frame from the receiver is received, the sender can continue sending. If a frame is in error, the receiver simply discards that frame, and the sender must retransmit that data frame after a timeout. Similar to the situation in 2), the only difference is that to achieve the maximum channel utilization, the send window size should be 2^{n-1}=4, thus the maximum channel utilization at this time is 4x0.02/0.58=13.8%."}

What is the minimum frame length?", "Answer": "For a 1km cable, the one-way propagation delay is 1/200000 = 5x10^(-6)s, which is 5\u03bcs, and the round-trip propagation delay is 10\u03bcs. To operate according to CSMA/CD, the minimum frame transmission time must not be less than 10us. When operating at a rate of 1Gb/s, the number of bits that can be sent within 10\u03bcs is (10x10^(-6))/(1x10^(-9)) = 10000, so the minimum frame should be 10000bit. Note: The contention period must be guaranteed to be greater than the round-trip delay. This is because if a frame is transmitted now and it finishes before the round-trip delay, and a collision occurs midway, the error cannot be detected; if a collision occurs midway and the frame has not yet finished transmitting, then the error can be detected. Therefore, to ensure the normal operation of CSMA/CD, the transmission time (i.e., the contention period) must be greater than or equal to the round-trip delay."}

The signal propagation speed in the cable is 200,000 km/s. If the minimum data frame length is reduced by 800 bits, by how much should the distance between the two furthest stations change to ensure the network operates correctly?", "Answer": "The CSMA/CD protocol requires that the minimum frame length must satisfy the condition: when transmitting the last bit of the frame, if a collision occurs, the sender should be able to detect the collision, meaning the frame transmission time must be at least the round-trip signal propagation time between the two farthest endpoints. Under the current condition, the frame length has been reduced by 800 bits, which means the frame transmission time is reduced by 800b/(1Gb/s), so the round-trip signal propagation time between the two farthest endpoints must also be reduced by 800b/(1Gb/s). Let the reduced length be x meters, to calculate the round-trip transmission distance, we have 2x/(200000x10^3) \u2265 800/(10^9), resulting in x \u2265 80m, which means the distance between the two farthest endpoints should be reduced by at least 80 meters."}

The key to solving the problem is to understand the units of the header length field and the total length field. Since the unit of the header length field is 4B, and the decimal equivalent of 101 is 5, the header length is 5x4=20B.

How long does it take to send the first full window?", "Answer": "Slow start congestion control addresses two potential issues, namely network capacity and receiver capacity, and deals with each issue separately. To this end, each sender maintains two windows: the receiver's advertised window and the congestion window. The number of bytes a sender can transmit is the minimum of these two windows. When establishing a connection, the sender initializes the congestion window to one maximum segment size (MSS) used on that connection. It then sends one MSS. If this segment is acknowledged before a timeout, the sender increases the congestion window to two MSS and sends two segments. After each transmitted segment is acknowledged, the congestion window is increased by one MSS. Therefore, when the congestion window is n segments, if all n segments are acknowledged in a timely manner, the congestion window will increase by n MSS, becoming 2n MSS. In fact, each burst of consecutive segments doubles the congestion window. The congestion window continues to grow exponentially until a timeout occurs or the boundary of the receiver's window is reached. The idea is that if bursts of 1024B, 2048B, and 4096B work well, but a burst of 8192B causes a timeout, then the congestion window should be set to 4096B to avoid congestion. As long as the congestion window remains at 4096B, no burst larger than 4096B will be sent, regardless of the window space allowed by the receiver. This algorithm is called slow start. All TCP implementations are now required to support this algorithm. Currently, the maximum segment size is 2KB, and the initial burst sizes are 2KB, 4KB, 8KB, and 16KB, followed by 24KB, which is the first full window. 10ms x 4 = 40ms, so it takes 40ms to send the first full window."}
{"ID": 1679, "Split": "Test", "Domain": "Computer Network", "SubDomain": "Transport Layer", "Format": "Open-ended", "Tag": "Reasoning", "Language": "English", "Question": "Assuming the initial slow start threshold of the TCP congestion window is 12 (in segments), and a timeout occurs when the congestion window reaches 16, the process re-enters slow start. How many round trips are required to return to the congestion window size at the moment of timeout?", "Answer": "In the slow start and congestion avoidance algorithms, the congestion window starts at 1, and the window size begins to grow exponentially. When the congestion window exceeds the slow start threshold, the slow start algorithm is no longer used, and the congestion avoidance algorithm is adopted instead. Initially, the slow start threshold is set to 12, and when the congestion window grows to 12, the congestion avoidance algorithm is used, with the window size increasing linearly by one segment each time. When the window size reaches 16, a timeout occurs, and the threshold is reset to 8 (half of 16), with the congestion window also reset to 1, and the slow start algorithm is executed again. Upon reaching the threshold of 8, the congestion avoidance algorithm is resumed. Thus, the changes in the congestion window are as follows: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, .... It can be seen that from the time a timeout occurs with the congestion window at 16 until the congestion window size recovers back to 16, it requires 11 round-trip times (RTTs). Note that when a timeout is detected, the change of the congestion window from 16 to 1 is immediate, without waiting for an RTT interval."}

(Frame length limitations are not considered.)", "Answer": "The goal is to send a maximum of 2^{32}B (with a 32-bit sequence number) within 120s, which is a payload of 35791394B/s. The payload of a TCP segment is 1500B, so 23861 segments can be sent. The TCP overhead is 20B, the IP overhead is 20B, and the Ethernet overhead is 26B (18B for header and trailer, 7B for preamble, 1B for frame start delimiter). This means that for a payload of 1500B, 1566B must be sent. 1566x8x23861=299Mb/s, so the maximum allowable line rate is 299Mb/s. Exceeding this speed risks having different TCP segments with the same sequence number at the same time."}

Tests show that the throughput is only 128kb/s. What is the window size? Ignore the overhead of PDU encapsulation and the transmission time of the receiver's acknowledgment packets (assuming the acknowledgment packets are very small).", "Answer": "The round-trip time delay is 128ms x 2 = 256ms. Let the window size be X (note: the unit is bytes). Assuming the maximum amount of data sent at once equals the window size, and the sending time is 256ms, then after each transmission, one must pause and wait for the acknowledgment of the next window to obtain permission for a new transmission. Thus, the sending time is equal to the time spent waiting for acknowledgment, and as a result, the measured average throughput is half the sending rate, which is 128kb/s. The calculation is as follows: 8X/(128x2x1000) = 256x0.001X = 256x1000x256 X0.001/8 = 256x32 = 8192. Therefore, the window size is 8192."}

If the subsequent 4 bursts of transmission are successful, how large will the window be?", "Answer": "In the TCP congestion control algorithm, in addition to using the slow start's receive window and congestion window, a third parameter is used, which is the threshold value. When a timeout occurs, this threshold value is set to half of the current congestion window value, that is, 9KB, and the congestion window is reset to one maximum segment size (MSS). Then, the slow start algorithm is used to determine the acceptable throughput of the network, growing until it reaches the threshold value. From this point on, successful transmissions linearly increase the congestion window, that is, after each round of transmission, only one MSS is added, instead of increasing the window value by one MSS after each segment transmission. Now, due to the timeout, the next transmission will be 1 MSS, followed by 2, 4, and 8 MSS. After the fourth successful transmission, with the threshold at 9KB, the congestion window will increase to 9KB after four rounds of transmission."}

Illustrate the domain name resolution process with an example. What is the role of the high-speed cache in domain name servers?", "Answer": "IP addresses are difficult to remember, so domain names were introduced to facilitate people's memory and recognition. Domain name resolution can convert domain names into IP addresses. The process of domain name conversion involves requesting resolution from the local domain name server; if the local server does not have the information, the query is then made to the root domain name server. If the root server also does not have the information, the query is made to the top-level domain servers and the corresponding authoritative domain servers stored in the root server, ensuring that the information can be found. The role of the high-speed cache in domain name servers is to store recently accessed domain name information in the cache. When these domain names are accessed again, the information is read from the cache instead of being resolved again, which speeds up the response time of domain name resolution."}

What roles do the master process and the slave process play?", "Answer": "The main working process of FTP is as follows: During file transfer, the transfer request issued by the FTP client is sent to the server-side control process through the control connection, which remains open throughout the entire session, but the control connection is not used for file transfer. After receiving the file transfer request from the FTP client, the server-side control process creates a data transfer process and a data connection. The data connection is used to connect the client and server data transfer processes, and the data transfer process actually completes the transfer of the file. After the transfer is complete, the \"data transfer connection\" is closed, and the process ends. The FTP server process consists of two main parts: a main process responsible for receiving new requests, and several subordinate processes responsible for handling individual requests."}

The control connection is for transmitting various FTP commands, while the data connection is for the transfer of files. This design is adopted because having two independent connections makes FTP simpler, easier to implement, and more efficient. Additionally, during the file transfer process, the control connection can be used to manage the transfer, such as allowing the client to request termination or pause of the transmission."}

Even in systems that use high-priority scheduling algorithms, when a highest-priority process enters the ready queue, it is necessary to consider whether preemption is allowed. If preemption is not allowed, the process must still wait."}

Whether a process can be scheduled also depends on the process scheduling policy. If a priority scheduling algorithm is used, then the process's priority becomes effective. As for the duration of processor occupation, it depends on the process itself. If the process is I/O-bound, it will frequently access I/O ports during execution, which means it may often relinquish the CPU, so it will not occupy the CPU for a long time. Once it gives up the CPU, it must wait for the next scheduling. If the process is CPU-bound, once it occupies the CPU, it may run for a long time. However, the running time also depends on the process scheduling policy. In most cases, interactive systems, to improve user response time, mostly adopt the round-robin algorithm with time slices.

CPU-bound jobs refer to those that require a significant amount of CPU time for computation and seldom request I/O operations; thus, using FCFS allows them to complete computations with ease. I/O-bound jobs, on the other hand, frequently request I/O operations during CPU processing, resulting in the need to re-queue and wait for scheduling after operations are completed. Therefore, CPU-bound jobs are closer to long jobs, and if FCFS is used, the waiting time can be excessively long.

In sequential search, if a component of the pathname is not found, it indicates that a certain directory or file in the pathname does not exist, and there is no need to continue the search, so C is correct. There are two methods for directory querying: sequential search and hash method. Sequential search is usually used, so A is incorrect. In a tree-structured directory, to speed up file searching, a current directory can be set, so the file path can start from the current directory, which makes B incorrect.

The disk transfers data to the buffer and then to the user area, which can be considered as parallel processing with the CPU data processing. The time spent depends on the maximum time consumed by the CPU, so the total time used by the system is T_3.

Semaphores are typically categorized into mutexes and counting semaphores. The initial value of a mutex is usually 1, indicating that only one process is allowed to enter the critical section at a time, thus ensuring mutual exclusion. When the mutex is 0, it means that one process has entered the critical section and no other processes are waiting outside; when the mutex is less than 0, it indicates that there is a process in the critical section, and the absolute value of the mutex represents the number of processes waiting to enter the critical section. Similarly, the initial value of a counting semaphore can be any integer, representing the number of available resources. When the counting semaphore is less than 0, it means that all resources have been exhausted and there are processes waiting to use the resource, with the number of waiting processes being the absolute value of the resource semaphore."}

{"ID": 2126, "Split": "Test", "Domain": "Operating System", "SubDomain": "Overview", "Format": "Open-ended", "Tag": "Knowledge", "Language": "English", "Question": "Why is it said that the concept of multiprogramming became useful only after the emergence of interrupt and channel technology?", "Answer": "Concurrent execution of multiple programs refers to some programs being executed on the CPU while others are being transferred on I/O devices. This overlapping of CPU operations and peripheral transfers in time requires the support of interrupt and channel technology for the following reasons: 1) A channel is a hardware mechanism that controls one or more external devices, and once initiated, it operates independently of the CPU, thus achieving parallel operation of input/output tasks with the CPU. However, the early method of communication between the CPU and the channel was for the CPU to issue inquiry commands to the channel to determine if the channel's work was completed. If not, the host would repeatedly inquire until the channel's work was finished. Therefore, this inquiry method could not truly achieve parallel operation between the CPU and I/O devices. 2) Interrupt technology was introduced in hardware. An interrupt is a signal sent by the corresponding hardware (i.e., the interrupt mechanism) to the CPU when input/output is finished, or when some hardware fault occurs. At this point, the CPU immediately stops its current work and turns to handle the interrupt request. After dealing with the interrupt, it continues with its original work. Thus, the combination of channel technology and interrupt technology can achieve parallel operation between the CPU and I/O devices. That is, after the CPU starts the channel to transfer data, it proceeds to perform computational tasks for other programs, while the channel carries out input/output operations. When the channel's work is finished, it sends an interrupt request to the CPU through the interrupt mechanism. The CPU then pauses the operation it is performing, deals with the interrupt, and after handling it, continues with its original work. In this way, true parallel operation between the CPU and I/O devices is achieved. Only then does the concept of multiprogramming become a reality."}

Please provide examples of situations where these relationships would form.\n\nOne-to-one: A single instance of a program is running as a single process, such as a user opening a text editor to edit a document.\n\nOne-to-many: A single program instance allows for the creation of multiple processes, like a web server handling multiple requests by spawning a new process for each request.\n\nMany-to-one: Multiple program instances are consolidated into a single process, as seen in some implementations of server applications that use threading to handle multiple instances within a single process.\n\nMany-to-many: Multiple instances of a program create multiple processes, which is common in distributed systems where various instances of a service run on different machines, each potentially handling multiple processes.", "Answer": "Consider the answer to the question from the concept of a process and the relationship between a process and a program. A process is the execution of a program, and it represents a program in execution, so the difference between a process and a program is implied in \"execution.\" A program is a static set of instructions, while a process is the dynamic execution of a program. A static program occupies disk space but does not require other system resources. Only an executing process needs to allocate system resources such as memory and CPU. The definition of a process clarifies two points: 1) A process is related to a program and contains the program. The program is the core content of a process; without a program, there is no process. 2) A process is not just a program; it also includes all the resources used during the program's execution. Without resources, a program cannot execute, so a process is the carrier of program execution. When running a program, the operating system first creates a process, allocates resources such as memory to it, and then adds it to the process queue for execution. For an individual process at a given moment, a process can only execute one program, and the relationship between a process and a program is one-to-one. However, considering the entire system's collection of processes and the lifecycle of processes, the relationship between processes and programs can be one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. The specific answers are as follows. When executing a command or running an application, a one-to-one relationship is formed between the process and the program. A process can load and execute different applications during its execution, forming a one-to-many relationship; executing the same application multiple times with different parameters or data forms a many-to-one relationship; concurrently executing different applications forms a many-to-many relationship."}

For terminal job users, since most of their submitted jobs are interactive and usually quite short, the system can satisfy these users by ensuring that these jobs are completed within the time slice specified by the first-level queue; for short batch job users, their jobs start like terminal jobs, and if they can be completed within a single time slice in the first-level queue, they can achieve the same response time as terminal jobs. For slightly longer jobs, they usually only need to execute one time slice in both the second-level and third-level queues to be completed, and their turnaround time remains short; for long batch job users, their long jobs will run consecutively in the first, second, ..., nth-level queues, and then operate in a round-robin fashion according to time slices, so users do not have to worry about their jobs not being processed for an extended period."}

Before the advent of monitors, access to critical sections was scattered across various processes, making it difficult to detect and correct improper uses of P and V operations dispersed in user programs. Monitors centralize these critical sections scattered among processes and provide control and management. A monitor allows only one process to enter at a time, thus facilitating the system's management of shared resources while ensuring mutual exclusion."}

At this point, regardless of whether the main memory is full (if full, one page needs to be swapped out first), a page fault will occur. That is, no matter how it is arranged, n different page numbers must experience a page fault the first time they enter the main memory, resulting in a total of n faults, which is the lower bound of the number of page faults. Although the number of different page numbers n is less than or equal to the total length p (the access sequence may have some pages repeated), the resident set m < n, so it is possible that some pages are swapped out of the main memory after being brought in, and a page fault occurs again when they are accessed again, meaning some pages may experience multiple page faults. The worst-case scenario is that every time a page number is accessed, that page is not in the main memory, resulting in a total of p faults. Therefore, for FIFO and LRU replacement algorithms, the upper bound of the number of page faults is p, and the lower bound is n. For example, when m=3, p=12, n=4, and the access sequence is 111223334444, the number of page faults is 4, which corresponds to the lower bound n.

FIFO replaces the page that entered main memory earliest, while LRU replaces the page that has not been accessed for the longest time since its last access, and these two pages are the same. That is to say, the page that first entered main memory must not be accessed again before this page fault occurs, so that this page is also the one that has not been accessed for the longest time. For example, when the legal resident set size is 4, for the access sequence 1,2,3,4,1,2,5, when page 5 is brought into main memory, one page should be selected for replacement from pages 1,2,3,4. FIFO would choose 1, while LRU would choose 3. The reason is that although page 1 entered main memory first, it was accessed again after entering, so it is not the page that has been left unaccessed for the longest time. If the second access to page 1 is removed, then the replacement choices of FIFO and LRU would be the same. Similarly, after page 5 is brought into main memory, if a new page 6 is accessed, page 2 will encounter the same issue. Therefore, by the same logic, all page numbers in the access sequence should be different. However, it should be noted that consecutive accesses to the same page do not affect the subsequent replacement choices, so the requirement for the access sequence is: non-consecutive page numbers must be different."}

However, in DMA control mode, the direction of data transfer, the starting address of the memory where data is stored, and the length of the data transfer are still controlled by the CPU. 3) DMA mode is memory-centric, while interrupt control mode is CPU-centric. Therefore, DMA mode can work in parallel with the CPU. 4) DMA mode transfers data in bulk, while interrupt control mode transfers data byte by byte."}

The channel control mode is similar to the DMA control mode, as it is also a memory-centric method for direct data exchange between devices and memory. However, in channel control mode, the CPU only needs to issue a start command, specifying the corresponding operations for the channel and the I/O device, and this command can initiate the channel and cause it to fetch the corresponding channel program from memory for execution. Compared to DMA control mode, channel control mode requires even less CPU intervention, and a single channel can control multiple devices, further reducing the CPU's workload. Additionally, for channels, it is possible to use some instructions to flexibly change the channel program, which is not possible in DMA control mode."}

Assuming that the computer reads and executes one 32-bit instruction per cycle without cycle stealing, by how much has the disk controller reduced the instruction execution speed?", "Answer": "In a 32-bit single-bus system, the disk controller uses DMA to transfer data at a rate of 40MB/s, which means 4B (32 bits) of data is transferred every 100ns. The controller appropriates one cycle for every 10 instructions read. As a result, the disk controller reduces the instruction execution speed by 10%."}

Assume each character has one start bit and one stop bit, totaling 10 bits.", "Answer": "Since one character occupies 10 bits, at a rate of 56kb/s, 56000/10=5600 characters are transmitted per second, resulting in 5600 interrupts.

Therefore, under a single buffer scenario, what is the processing time for a block of data when the system handles a large amount of data?", "Answer": "In the case of single buffering, a block of data should first be read from the disk into the buffer, which takes time T; then the operating system transfers the data from the buffer to the user space, taking time M; subsequently, the CPU computes on this block of data, with a computation time of C. Since the CPU's computation can be performed in parallel with the disk's data input operation, the processing time for a block of data is max(C,T) + M."}

Therefore, in the case of double buffering, what is the processing time for a block of data when the system handles a large amount of data?", "Answer": "In the case of double buffering, initially both buffers are empty. The first step is to load a block of data from the disk into the first buffer. Once the first buffer is full, the operating system can transfer the data from the first buffer to the user space and start processing the first block of data. At the same time, data from the disk can be loaded into the second buffer. After processing is complete, if the second buffer is full, the data from the second buffer can be transferred to the user space for processing the second block of data, while disk input data can be loaded into the first buffer. This alternating use of the two buffers continues. The time it takes for the CPU to process the data in one buffer is C+M, while the time to prepare the data in another buffer is T. Therefore, when C+M > T, as soon as the CPU finishes processing the data in one buffer, the data in the other buffer is ready, allowing immediate processing of the next block of data. Thus, on average, the time taken to process each block of data is C+M. However, when C+M < T, after the CPU finishes processing the data in one buffer, the data in the other buffer is not yet ready, so processing of the next block of data can only begin after every T interval, making the average time to process each block of data T. In summary, with double buffering, the average time taken to process a block of data is max(C+M, T)."}

Since all the heads are fixed together, data is stored by filling up sectors first, then tracks, and finally cylinders. The logical record number 3468 corresponds to cylinder number 3468/64=54; the corresponding track number is (3468 MOD 64) DIV 8=1; and the corresponding sector number is (3468 MOD 64) MOD 8=4."}

Reading and processing record A takes 5ms, by which time the read head has moved to the middle of record B, so to read record B, it must rotate almost a full circle (from the middle of record B to record B).

The average rotational latency and transfer time per block are 100ms and 25ms, respectively. How long does it take to read a file of 100 blocks? If the system defragments the disk, making the blocks of the same file as close as possible, thus reducing the average distance between logically adjacent blocks to 2 tracks, how long does it take to read a file of 100 blocks?", "Answer": "Before disk defragmentation, the average distance between logically adjacent data blocks is 13 tracks, and the time required to read one block of data is 13x6 + 100 + 25 = 203ms. Therefore, the time required to read a file of 100 blocks is 203x100 = 20300ms.
